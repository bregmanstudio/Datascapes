	* Fixed erroneusly labeled JPG files for integral CR maps.

2008-12-17
	* Re converted and relabeled all fits to JPG.
          Used a common font available on any CPU.

2008-05-28
	* Done with reprocessing and with correcting the point size
          in some of the JPG files. 4 per day maps through 2008-03-20
          and then 1 per hour after that.

2008-05-01
	* Mostly done with updated software and pipeline redesign.
          The updated software fixes the annual periodicity and some
          other pole issues we located. And the pipeline redesign
          has increased our synoptic map cadence to a more regulated
          once-per-hour.
        
2008-03-19
        * Change to use of standard polefilled image for janus construction.
	* Installation of new polefiller2d software for integral synoptic maps.
        * Still using original polefiller for hourly synoptic maps.

2008-03-17
	* During the last few days we had some runaway processes on the
          main CPU that created a very busy machine which in turn
          caused the mapmap software to take 5 or 6 hours to generate
          a single one hour synoptic map.

2008-01-14
	* Put up NOTICE about periodicity in data.
        
2007-12-06
	* Added movies for all Integral Models
        * Added movies for the two Open Field Change Models

2007-12-04
	* Added Field Change Models for Integral CR Synoptic Maps
	* Added Standard Models for Integral CR Synoptic Maps

2007-11-29

	* Changed product names for integral synoptic maps
          (since uppercase cannot be used):
             mqs == bqS - synoptic map (integral) 		FITS
             mqj == bqJ - synoptic map (integral) 		JPG

2007-10-06
	* Added web pages for new stereo models.

	* New products:
             bq8 - model - stereo A plot
             bq9 - model - stereo B plot
             bqw - combination object: bq8 bqg bq9

2007-10-03
	* A side effect of using The Keep to serve objects from
          is that all fits files are stored in GZIP (*.gz) format.

	* Using The Keep style tree to serve objects means that the JPG
          versions of the synoptic maps are now formal data products.
          Here is a quick summary of data product names:

             bqs - synoptic map (standard) 		FITS
             bqj - synoptic map (janus)    		FITS
             bqS - synoptic map (integral) 		FITS

             bq1 - synoptic map (standard) 		JPG
             bq2 - synoptic map (janus)    		JPG
             bqJ - synoptic map (integral) 		JPG

             bqf - Synoptic Coronal Hole Plot 		GIF
             bqg - Line-Of-Sight Coronal Hole Plot 	GIF
             bq3 - Synoptic Field Plot 			GIF
             bq4 - Line-Of-Sight Field Plot      	GIF
             bq5 - Synoptic Ecliptic-Plane Field Plot 	GIF
             bq6 - Line-Of-Sight Ecliptic-Plane Field Plot GIF
             bq7 - Top View Ecliptic-Plane Field Plot 	GIF
             bqc - model coefficients      		TXT (.dat)

             bqA - combination object: bq1 and bq2
             bqC - combination object: bq1 and bqf
             bqG - combination object: bqf and bqg

2007-10-01
	* Rewrite all FITS headers into the new GONG standard.
          Synoptic Maps affected: Integral CR, Standard Hourly, Janus Hourly
        
	* Make sure all FITS files are in units 'gauss' and have the proper
          BUNIT keyword in place.
          Synoptic Maps affected: Integral CR, Standard Hourly, Janus Hourly

	* Change archive storage to the GONG style date-tree structure known
          as "The Keep".
          
	* Change web page generator to serve direct from "The Keep".
          
2007-09-28
	* Modified magnetogram pipeline to rewrite FITS headers for all
          FITS file products.

2007-08-23
	* Modified to generate 40 coefficients instead of 20.

2007-08-22
	* Modified product names to be of the form sstttYYMMDDtHHMMcCCCC_DDD_L.*
	  eg. mrbqs070714t2359c2050_003.fits which is the standard GONG
          name concatenated with the current Carrington Rotation number
          and degree.
