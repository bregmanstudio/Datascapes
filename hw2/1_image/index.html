<h2>Local Server</h2>

Because javascript is a Web language, and we are operating the program from within a browser, whenever we need to access assets from a folder, we need to be running a <a href="https://github.com/processing/p5.js/wiki/Local-server">local server.</a> This means that your computer will behave as if it is a Web server to programs running on it when they make requests for Web resources via <code>http://localhost:8080</code>. Be sure to run the <code>http-server</code> from a folder that is either your sketch folder, or one of its parent folders.

<h4>Node http-server</h4>
Node.js is a javascript library framework that provides distributed Web client/server functionality to javascript. We will only be using the stand-alone <code>http-server</code> to provide a light-weight local Web server so that we can develop and run Web-ready sketches on our machines without requiring logging into a production Web server.<br /><br />
To begin, download and install <a href="http://nodejs.org/download">node.js</a>. Then, open a terminal or command prompt and do the following:

On OSX/Linux type:
<pre style="background:#F0F0FF;width:800px;">
sudo npm install -g http-server
</pre>

On Windows type (you might need to open the command prompt as admin)
<pre style="background:#F0F0FF;width:800px;">
npm install -g http-server
</pre>

Then you're done!

From then on, open a terminal and <code>cd YOUR_SKETCH_DIR</code> for the files you want to serve and type:

<pre style="background:#F0F0FF;width:800px;">
http-server
</pre>

This will run the Web server in the terminal. Now, go back to your browser and in its address bar type <code>http://localhost:8080/</code>, and the Web files and folders should work as expected, with images, videos, and sounds served from your sketch folder. Do not try to use the File->open menu option in the browser to open your .html files, as they will not be able to load image/video/audio assets this way. So, always use <code>http://localhost:8080/</code>

<h2>Image</h2>

We load images into p5js using <code>loadImage()</code>. Make sure your images are stored in a folder within the current sketch folder. 
<pre>
var im;

function preload(){ // Use to load assets into sketch
	im = loadImage("assets/chdm_big.jpg");	
}

function setup(){
	createCanvas(400,400);
}

function draw(){
	image(im, 0, 0, width, height);	// scale to width and height
}
</pre>
